### Project Overview: Data Analysis involves Inspecting,Cleaning,Transforming and Modeling data to discover useful informations,draw conclusions and support decision making.The pharse 'DATA IS LIFE' cannot be over emphasis here because data help business make informed decision ,understand customer behaviours,improve operations and predict future .Data Ananlysis help the organisation to identify what is working, what is not working and what should be the major focus of the organistion to maximize profit.This project is to give an insight to all my learnings during the class activities in the Ladies In Tech Africa Data Analysis Class. By using three major tools(EXCEL,Structured Query Language SQL, AND POWER BI)

### Data Cleaning and preparations
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations ,we perform the following action;

EDA involve the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers

 ### Data Analysis
 Data analysis was carried out during the class through some basic functions in excel,pivot tables  and lines of code or structured query languages  even some DAX expressions were used during our analysis. Some of the functions include;
 
```Excel functions
-Excel functions
=SUM(TEXT)
=AVERAGE(D8:D27)
=MAX(D8:D27)
=MIN(D8:D2
-Cleaning functions in Excel
=UPPER
=LOWER
=PROPER
-Text extraction function in Excel
=VLOOK UP

```

```SQL

SELECT*FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE

UPDATE TABLE 1
TRUNCATE TABLE1
DELETE FROM TABLE 1
